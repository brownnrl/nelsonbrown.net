Chapter 2
=========

Example 2.1
-----------

I had to remind myself of tail recursive call syntax, and a quick Google search yielded an example in Python. I took this example, and converted it to Scala. I figured leaving the acknowledgement, both of the example's use and my own failure of memory :) was a reasonable thing to do.

Here we try this example by trying a call to :code:`fib`.

.. ipynb:: /pages/notebooks/fp_in_scala/chap2.ipynb
    :id: try ex_2.1
